# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz
A timed quiz on JS fundamentals that stores high scores alongside initials at the end of the quiz 

# Some acceptance criteria have changed for personal preference
~ Timer increases rather than decreases so you can continue to play the game without time running out
~ Time/points aren't deducted. Beating your previous high score and other scores is the incentive to get the questions right
~ Highscores can only be viewed once you have played the game
